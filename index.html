  <p class="small-text">Everything we see around us constitutes nature, including the sun, the moon, trees, flowers, fruits, human beings, birds, animals, etc. In nature, everyone depends on one another to keep the ecosystem healthy. For survival, every creature is interrelated and reliant on one another. Humans, for example, rely on nature for their survival, and nature provides us with oxygen, food, water, shelter, medicines, and clothing, among other things.</p>

<p class="sectag" >Beauty Of The Nature</p>
<p class="secsubtag">Nature is beautiful, yet it is difficult to put into words. Nature is honoured with a variety of religious traditions. The primary source of life on Earth is the components that exist naturally. All of the elements are linked. Natural ingredients can never be substituted. Humans process natural materials for use in todayâ€™s ever-changing world and destroy its rawness and individuality. Human activities have an impact on nature, and as a result, the quality of the environment is deteriorating. Deterioration of nature is primarily caused by pollution of the air and water. The oxygen produced by a single fully grown tree is enough to supply ten people, and the amount of oxygen released by a forest is unquestionably adequate for a metropolis or town. Nature is a healer, and it is the foundation for many industries. Nature, on the other hand, is both a giver and a taker, according to legends. Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, floods, and cyclones are examples of natural calamities. These disasters, which occur as a result of natural causes, have resulted in significant damage.</p>

    <div class="secright-right">
<p class="sectag">Explanation</p>
<p class="secsubtag">The natural cycle of our ecosystem is vital for the survival of organisms. We all should take care of all the components that make our nature complete. We should be sure not to pollute the water and air as they are gifts of Nature.
Mother nature fosters us and never harms us. Those who live close to nature are observed to be enjoying a healthy and peaceful life in comparison to those who live in urban areas. Nature gives the sound of running fresh air which revives us, sweet sounds of birds that touch our ears, and sounds of breezing waves in the ocean makes us move within.

<p class="sectag">Conclusion</p>
<p class="secsubtag">Nowadays, technological advancement is adversely affecting our nature. Humans are in the quest and search for prosperity and success that they have forgotten the value and importance of beautiful Nature around. The ignorance of nature by humans is the biggest threat to nature. It is essential to make people aware and make them understand the importance of nature so that they do not destroy it in the search for prosperity and success.
     On high priority, we should take care of nature so that nature can continue to take care of us. Saving nature is the crying need of our time and we should not ignore it. We should embrace simple living and high thinking as the adage of our lives. </p>
